    "# Classifying a Single Target\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the photometric classification of a single supernova (SN) from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). It is a simplified example intended to outline the general classification technique introduced by Gonz치lez-Gait치n et al. 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two approaches are demonstrated in this notebook. In the first, data is split into rest frame red and rest frame blue bandpasses. Fits are then performed to both the blue and red data using models for a normal and 91bg-like supernova. The resulting classification of the target is determined using the relative quality of fit (normal chi-squared - 91bg-like chi-squared) in both bandpass collections. In the second approach, fits are performed in each bandpass independently and results are seperated afterword into red and blue bands. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of this notebook is intended to introduce the general concept. The second notebook introduces some important extra-details.\n",
