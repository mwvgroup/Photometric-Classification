# SDSS-Classification

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mwvgroup/SDSS-Classification.svg?token=MKWwaqNeMpyaNQ2HGxM7&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mwvgroup/SDSS-Classification)

  This repository applies the photometric classification technique from González-Gaitan 
  2014 on SDSS and DES data to identify peculiar Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). 
  Work on the accompanying paper can be found [here](https://github.com/mwvgroup/91bg_paper).

## Todo:

- SNCosmo will raise occasional warnings about poor fits, bad S/N, and dropped bands. These warnings are currently being logged but otherwise ignored and need to be considered more in depth.

- If a redshift for a supernova is not available, SNCosmo is instructed to fit for the redshift. A prior needs to be provided for the redshift.

- The `num_points_<band>` column in the fit summary tables contain the number of data points per observer frame band. We are interested in the number of points in the rest frame.

- We are currently fitting data with SNCosmo's built-in 91bg model, but want to use our own custom model. This custom model is currently used to simulate SNANA light curves.

- Determine what K-correction was used in the published SDSS / DES fit results and improve the quality of fits with large chi-squared compared to published results.

- Perform a figure of merit calculation to identify classification boundaries.

- Summarize properties of peculiar SN based on their light curves (Write a paper)

## Directory Overview and File List

#### *data_access/* 

  A Python 3.7 module for accessing SDSS, DES, and CSP supernova
  data. Data is downloaded automatically if it is not locally available. An
  example of accessing SDSS data is provided below. The interface for DES or
  CSP is the same, except you would import `des` or `csp` instead of
  `sdss`.

```python
  from data_access import sdss
  
  # Summary table of SDSS SN data
  print(sdss.master_table) 
  
  # Get SDSS data for a specific object
  print(sdss.get_data_for_id(685))
  
  # Get SNCosmo input table for a specific object
  print(sdss.get_input_for_id(685))
  
  # Iterable of SNCosmo input tables for each target
  for table in sdss_data.iter_sncosmo_input():
      print(table)
```

#### tests/

  A test suite for the *data_access/* module.

#### snana_sims/ 

  Simulating 91bg light curves using the SNANA Fortran package

- **sim_91bg.input:** An input file to SNANA that generates simulation results
- **snana_results/:** Directory of simulation results generated by *sim_91bg.input*


#### sncosmo_fits/

  Fitting SDSS and DES data with the SNCosmo python package

- **fit_sdss.py:** Uses SNCosmo to fit SDSSS light curves with a normal sn Ia model and the builtin 91bg model in the `ug`, `riz`, and `ugriz` rest frame bands.
- **fit_des.py:** The same as *fit_sdss.py* except for DES data.

#### analysis

  A collection of notebooks performing data analysis on the light curve fit results.

- **apply_classification.ipynb:** Compares fit results between the normal and 91bg models in different bands and classifies peculiar SN.
- **compare_to_published.ipynb:** Compares fit results with published results.

## Notes on the SDSS-II SN Survey Data (Sako et al. 2018)

- Observed during three-month campaigns in Fall 2005, 2006, and 2007 as part of an extension to the original SDSS.
- SN span redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.4 (Frieman et al. 2008). 
- 10,258 Included sources. 3225 Variable, 499 classified as SN Ia, and 86 as Core collapse.
- All objects were observed in two or more filters and visually inspected to ensure they were not artifacts.
- Classification schemes:
  - **Unknown:** The light curve was too sparse and/or noisy to make a useful classification.
  - **Variable:** The source was observed in more than one observing season (and hence is not a supernova).
  - **AGN:** An optical spectrum was identified as having features associated with an active galaxy.
  - **SNII, SNIbc (either Ib or Ic), SNIa:** 
    - SN classifications without prefixes are based on a spectrum (including a few non-SDSS spectra)
    - A prefix “p” indicates the redshift is unknown and that the identification was made with photometric data only
    - A prefix “z” indicates that a redshift is measured from its candidate host galaxy and the classification uses that redshift as a prior. 
  - **SN Ia?:** classification is based on a spectrum that suggests a SN Ia but is inconclusive.
- Some SN candidates have associated notes indicating candidates that may have peculiar features or candidates where the typing spectrum was obtained by other groups. Quoting the data release: "We did not search for these peculiar features in a systematic way, but we have noted the likely peculiar features that were found." The flags are given in Table 4 and are as follows:
  - **1**  SN typing based on spectra obtained by groups outside SDSS. The spectra used for typing are not included in the data release. 
  - **2**  Peculiar type Ia SN possibly similar to sn91bg 
  - **3**  Peculiar type Ia SN possibly similar to sn00cx 
  - **4**  Peculiar type Ia SN possibly similar to sn02ci 
  - **5**  Peculiar type Ia SN possibly similar to sn02cx 
- Light curve fits are performed using PSNID, SALT2, and MLCS2k2
  - SALT2 fits are performed both with and without providing a spectroscopic redshift (where available). When fitting for redshift a flat prior is used.
  - Only data with a photometric flag less than 1024 is used for the fit. A full overview of the flag values is provided in Holtzman et al. 2008.
  - Epochs earlier than 15 days or later than 45 days in the rest frame are ignored. 152 epochs in 105 SN were also ignored after being visually classified as outliers.
  - Published fits use the SALT2 model as implemented in SNANA version 10.31b and the spectral templates and color law reported in Guy et al. (2010, G10)
  - Fits are performed using the Doi et al. 2010 SDSS filter response curves. These are available online [here](http://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~doi/sdss/SDSSresponse.html).
- The magnitudes in the online data release use the SDSS inverse hyperbolic sine magnitude system. These different from the standard AB system by an additive constant found in Table 7. The fluxes in the online files have already been converted to to the AB system and are given in Micro-Janskies.

## Notes on the DES Year 3 Cosmology Data (Brout, Sako et al. 2019 and Brout, Scolnic et al. 2019) 

- Five year survey from 2013 - 2018 in *ugriz* within 0.017 < z < 0.849
-  Average cadence of 7 days per filter
- These results contain the first three years of DES from Sept. 2013 to Feb. 2016
  - Discovered ∼12,000 transients
  - ∼3,000 identified as likely SNe Ia based on their light curves and out of 533 targeted for spectroscopic classification 251 were confirmed (D’Andrea et al. 2018).
  - These papers include a low-z SN sample from CfA3, CfA4, and CSP1. It's not clear if the the numbers above include the low-z sample.
  
- The 31.00 zero point is for internal DES use. The ZP in the public data files is 27.5.
