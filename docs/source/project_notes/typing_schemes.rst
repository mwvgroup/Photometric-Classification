The standard classification of supernovae is defined by identifying spectral
features near maximum light. Sev- eral classification schemes for SNe Ia have
been proposed, notably those by Benetti et al. (2005), Branch et al. (2006)
and Wang et al. (2009a), all based on prominent line properties such as
Silicon strength, velocity and velocity gradient. Additionally, some
automated clas- sification tools such as SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007) or
GELATO2 (Harutyunyan et al. 2008) have been presented for general use.
